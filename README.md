Web3 users are more cautious than ever. When they open your dApp through the Phantom wallet and see red warning banners like:

> ⚠️ *"This app may compromise your funds or data"*

…most will **abandon your app immediately** — even if your code is completely safe.

This happens due to:

- Missing or improperly implemented `signAndSendTransaction` flows  
- Lack of Blowfish review and verification  
- No presence or activity from your GitHub and X (Twitter) accounts  
- Most importantly: No **trusted developer vouch**  

We solve all of that. Period.

## ✅ Our Core Services for Phantom and Blowfish Verification

### 🔐 Phantom Wallet Warning Removal  
We analyze and fix the specific factors causing your dApp to be flagged by Phantom. Whether it’s improper transaction signing, missing metadata, or a lack of whitelist approval — we get it done fast.

### 🧩 Blowfish Verification Support  
We guide you through the entire Blowfish verification process — from security checks to formal submissions — ensuring that your app meets the criteria to be marked safe by Phantom.

### 🛡️ signAndSendTransaction Audits  
Our team audits your implementation of `signAndSendTransaction`, identifying and resolving the issues that trigger warnings. We ensure your dApp follows all best practices required by Phantom.

### 🛠️ Full Solana dApp Compliance  
Need broader support? We help align your app with the Solana ecosystem's technical standards — including smart contract structure, endpoint validation, metadata accuracy, and more.

### 🧑‍💻 Trusted Developer Vouching  
One of the biggest hurdles in the Blowfish process is getting vouched for by a recognized Solana developer. We provide this — along with optimization of your GitHub and X profiles to reflect legitimacy and activity.
