# Blowfish Verification – Phantom Whitelist Services for Solana dApps

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of **Blowfish Verification**, the leading independent service specializing in **Phantom whitelist services**, **Blowfish verification support**, and **Solana dApp compliance**. Our mission is to help Web3 developers eliminate Phantom wallet warnings, gain user trust, and achieve secure and compliant dApp integration on the Solana blockchain.

## 🚀 What We Do

Modern Web3 users expect a seamless, secure experience—especially when interacting with Solana dApps via the Phantom wallet. Unfortunately, even well-built dApps are frequently flagged with red warnings like:

> ⚠️ *“This dApp may compromise your funds or data”*

This message often appears due to:
- Improper or missing `signAndSendTransaction` implementations
- Lack of Blowfish verification
- Inactive or unverified GitHub/X accounts
- Absence of trusted developer vouches

That’s where **Blowfish Verification** comes in.
